Architecture

This SQL Server Data Warehouse follows a layered architecture that clearly separates data ingestion, transformation, and analytics to ensure performance, reliability,
and governance.

Data from CRM and ERP systems is ingested into SQL Server and stored in the Bronze layer, preserving raw source data. 
It is then validated, cleansed, and transformed in the Silver layer. 
The Gold layer contains business-ready fact and dimension models along with query-optimized views designed for reporting and BI consumption.

This design provides end-to-end data traceability, consistent business metrics, and scalable analytics while keeping source systems and business logic cleanly isolated.
