This SQL Server Data Warehouse is built using a modern, layered design that separates raw ingestion, business transformation, and analytical consumption to ensure reliability and performance.

Data is first ingested into staging tables for validation and standardization. Cleaned data is then modeled into business-ready fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical workloads. The final layer exposes query-optimized views designed for reporting and BI tools.

This architecture enables scalable data processing, consistent metrics, and fast analytical querying while keeping source data isolated from business logic.
